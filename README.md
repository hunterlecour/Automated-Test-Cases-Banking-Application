# Guru99 Bank Project


#### This project is put in a corporate test environment where the Automation QA Engineer (myself) will be automating Selenium test cases for a demo banking website.


## Project Description

- Guru99 Bank has assigned me to test the demo bank website's efficiency
- These tests are meant to find bugs that contribute to poor quality, visibility, and functionality of the bank's website
- This type of testing will allow the company to indentify inefficiencies and fix these bugs in order to increase the websites optimization
- This project will illustrate my capabilities executing a series of test cases in an organized fashion that fits a proper corporate environment 

## Tech/ Framework Used

 - Knowledge in Python program language, Selenium, and Behave
 - IDE that can install Python, Selenium, and Behave
 - Test Case Documentation
 - Software Requirements Specification Documentation
 - Scripts that are formed around Test Case and Software Requirements Specification Documentation
 - An understanding of the Page Object Model
## How To Run/Use This Project

This project was built by GURU99 and is required for a project participant to be enrolled in their free real time project.

This is because I was given access to the demo bank's website application with a specific userid and password that expires 20 days after enrollment.

The scripts created run through the website, which requires a live userid and password

The feature files located here : Selenium-Project-Banking-Final/features/tests are test cases that are built using behave. Each file represents sections of the website I tested for organization purposes.

Running each file will automate each Test Case Scenario in the specific file at once

If the Tester wishes to run each individual Test Case Scenario, hover over any line of code in the desired feature file that represents a step in the desired scenario and run the line. That will run that specific Test Case Scenario.

Each Test Case Scenario represents a Test Case I tested to assure efficiency of the banking application.

## How To Read This Project

In addition to my work, I have created a [google worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PrIcX9j7LpSn9HRZY7WYv6VZ7k4RD8t79Z0fxLG8rU4/edit?usp=sharing) where I share my customized Bug Reports on the tests I executed for this project. Actual and expected results included. 

Viewers have an option to read my Bug Reports while analyzing through each Test Case Scenario to give better perspective on what they're viewing.

I provide detail in steps and indentify my process through successful test cases and/or unsuccessful test cases.

I have also provided the results of each test case scenario execution through allure. In order to see the details of each test cases on allure, you must fork the repository (to make your own), copy it to your local computer, and use the command "allure serve test_results/" in your IDE's terminal. This should present the test cases results in Allure with screenshot attachments.

Since these steps will expire, its important to have an understanding of Python, Selenium, Behave, and the Page Object Model to comprehend my work.

My steps are organized in a Page Object Model in the python files here: 

Selenium-Project-Banking-Final/pages

Each file represents sections of the website I tested for organization purposes. Similarly to the feature files.
## How To Contribute To This Project

User can sign up for Guru99's Selenium Live Project [here](https://www.guru99.com/live-selenium-project.html). This will allow the user to get their own live userid and password for the banking application. With this, a user can access the banking application and start testing!

Guru99 will provide a list of made test cases that need to be tested. Users can also go through exploratory testing and create their own test cases as an option.

My test cases are built around my unique userid's, passwords, fictional account & customer id's, etc. These are expired due to my completion of the project.

A user should feel free to use my work for ideas on how to execute their own set of test case scenarios! 
## Project Status

This Project is considered complete but their always room for improving in Test Automation. 
## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by [Guru99's Selenium Live Project](https://www.guru99.com/live-selenium-project.html) where I implemented my skills to execute test cases around their demo banking application!

Many thanks to them and my educators!
