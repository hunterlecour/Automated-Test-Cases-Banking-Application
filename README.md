- This type of testing will allow the company to indentify inefficiencies and fix these bugs in order to increase the websites optimization
- This project will illustrate my capabilities executing a series of test cases in an organized fashion that fits a proper corporate environment 

## Tech/ Framework Used

 - Knowledge in Python program language, Selenium, and Behave
 - IDE that can install Python, Selenium, and Behave

 - Software Requirements Specification Documentation
 - Scripts that are formed around Test Case and Software Requirements Specification Documentation
## How To Run This Project

This project was built by GURU99 and is required for a project participant to be enrolled in their free real time project.

This is because I was given access to the demo bank's website application with a specific userid and password that expires 20 days after enrollment.

As a reference to my work, I have created a google worksheet where I share my customized bug report on the test cases I executed for this project.
